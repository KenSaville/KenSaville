- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KenSaville
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in genetics, genomics and bioinnformatics
- I teach genetics at Albion College in Michigan www.albion.edu
- Recently I joined the team at [latch bio](https://latch.bio/) as a biocomputing ambassador.
- Latch is an end-to-end platform to accelerate scientific discovery. Biologists can organize 
- data and run workflows, bioinformaticians can upload custom workflows, and computational biologists can perform downstream analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to create and run workflows on the Latch platform

I can always be reached at ksaville@albion.edu
